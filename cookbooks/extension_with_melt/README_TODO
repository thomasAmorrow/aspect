1a. Add elasticity and perform bending beam benchmarks in Keller et al. paper
1b. Modify finite strain to only track plastic strain
2.  Design a suite of tests to understand the physics of the yielding model
3.  Reproduce Keller et al., 2013 GJI experiments (this will be a cookbook)
4.  Design 2-D and 3-D extension experiments
